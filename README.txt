To view the data as presented in the Jupyter notebook:

1) Please install Jupyter if you do not have it already. We recommend installing Anaconda (which contains Jupyter) at

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

to get all the Python prequisites, in addition to Jupyter itself.

2) Open Jupyter either by clicking on its icon, or by typing "jupyter notebook" in a terminal. This will open up Jupyter within your default internet browser. 

3) Determine the operating directory of Jupyter, and unzip the contents of "ELIFE_tCYCIF_jupyter_notebook.zip" into this directory.

4) From the default browser in which Jupyter was opened, find "16cycleplots.ipynb", then click on it to open the notebook. From there, the notebook itself contains specific instructions for how to view the data.

5) Please refer to "Antibody_list_SampleA.csv" & "Antibody_list_SampleB.csv" for detailed info about antibodies used.
