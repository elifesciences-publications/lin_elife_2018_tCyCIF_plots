Introduction
============

Tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescent microscopy (t-CyCIF) is a simple method
for generating highly multiplexed optical images from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples routinely used for histopathological
diagnosis of human disease. The method is described in Lin et al. (2018),
[*Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of human tissues and tumors
using t-CyCIF and conventional optical microscopes*
](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31657).

Here we have reproduced several key figures from the manuscript as an
interactive Jupyter notebook. Whereas the manuscript only has space for plots
of a few antibody combinations from a few samples, this notebook allows
replotting of any combination available in the full dataset.

Instructions
============

To view the data interactively:

1. First, install Jupyter. If you are new to Python, we recommend installing
   Anaconda Python (which contains Jupyter). You must get the Python 3.6
   version of Anaconda, not the 2.7 version!

1. Open Jupyter either by clicking on its icon, or by typing `jupyter notebook`
   in a terminal. This will open up Jupyter in your web browser.

1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the .ipynb file and the data
   files.

1. Click on `figure_6.ipynb` to open the notebook. From there, click
   "Cell" and then "Run All" from the menu.

Please refer to `Antibody_list_SampleA.csv` & `Antibody_list_SampleB.csv` for
detailed information about the antibodies used.
