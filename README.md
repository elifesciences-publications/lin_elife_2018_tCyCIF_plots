To view the data interactively:

1. First, install Jupyter. If you are new to Python, we recommend installing
   Anaconda Python (which contains Jupyter). You must get the Python 3.6
   version of Anaconda, not the 2.7 version!

1. Open Jupyter either by clicking on its icon, or by typing `jupyter notebook`
   in a terminal. This will open up Jupyter in your web browser.

1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the .ipynb file and the data
   files.

1. Click on `16cycleplots.ipynb` to open the notebook. From there, click
   "Cell" and then "Run All" from the menu.

Please refer to `Antibody_list_SampleA.csv` & `Antibody_list_SampleB.csv` for
detailed information about the antibodies used.
